## Instructions: 

The purpose of this project is to create a simple weather app that has the following functionality:

- Allow the user to select from a list of cities
- When a user selects a city - display its weather information

#### Functionality
- Allow the user to select a city from a dropdown list (from at least 10 cities)
- When a user selects a city:
  - Make a GET request to Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/appid) to retrieve weather information for the city.
  - Display the weather information for the city on the webpage 
  
#### Working with Open Weather
- You will need to sign up for an account and get a free API Key 
- Their docs show how to make an API request to get weather data (https://openweathermap.org/appid). 
- You may have to map each city name to a city code when sending requests to Open Weather

#### Tips:
- Think about creating a react component to display weather information. 
- Feel free to ask any questions you may have. 

## Deliverables:
- A working webpage where I can select different cities from a dropdown and view their weather information
- When I select a city, the weather information should automatically update
- Well-commented code

## Good Luck!
